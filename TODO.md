Generate a PRD
Write PRD using a sample template (you can also write to Google Docs to share with others)
Generate tasks from PRD
Update Tasks from PRD (analyze for changes using git)
Analyze Complexity
Breakdown complex tasks into smaller tasks

Create a cycle of Tasks
Write tests (optional)
Write documentation (optional)

Feature Segregation - UI, Code, Layout, AI, ...
Figma and make changes, Drawings and make changes, Inspect elements and make changes
Auto detect console errors and fix them

Statistics:
- Tokens used
- Time taken
- Errors
- How much time you had to re-prompt to get it right?



	// * Labels
	// - This is for developer's reference
	// * Milestones
	// 1. Create an MVP
	// 2. Add support for multiple users
	// 3. Create PRD for each milestone
	// * Tasks
	// - Blocking, Blocked By
	// - Bug / New Feature / Improvement
	// - Backlog, Planned, In Progress, Completed / Cancelled
	// * Cycles
	// Suggest Features

	// Ollama support (tasks generated by Claude and Perplexity right now)

	// Two way task/PRD sync
	// Generate test file for any task file to easily verify functionality and improve code stability as Cursor implements other tasks
	// Bulk verify implementation and mark all related tasks as done â€” makes it easier to drop this into an existing project

- Revising and asking for input to refine the 
- Staring new threads when required
- Assistants with specific roles - Testing, Documentation, Code Review, Release & Deployment, Security Vulnerabilities Scanner
- Language-Specific Optimization Techniques
- Dividing larger codebases into smaller understandable tokens to understand what is happening and making calls accordingly
